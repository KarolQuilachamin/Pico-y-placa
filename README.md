# Pico-y-placa

This program is a Peak and Plate simulator and consists of 4 files.
"library" in this file there are 3 functions that allow us to validate the three input data. "day" that allows entering the date and obtaining the day to which it corresponds, "time" that allows us to know if the entered time is within the range allowed by the Peak and Plate, and "plate" that returns the last digit of the plate entered.
